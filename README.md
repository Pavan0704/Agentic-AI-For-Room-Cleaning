# Agentic-AI-For-Room-Cleaning

This project simulates a simple reflex agent in a 2x2 environment. The agent's goal is to clean "dirty" rooms. The simulation visualizes the agent's movement and cleaning actions within the environment. It demonstrates a basic example of an artificial intelligence agent reacting to its immediate environment state.
